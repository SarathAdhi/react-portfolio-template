## Why do you need a portfolio? ‚òùÔ∏è

- Professional way to showcase your work
- Increases your visibility and online presence
- Shows you‚Äôre more than just a resume

## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites üìã

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [NPM](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer.

Also, you can use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of NPM ‚òùÔ∏è

## How To Use üîß

From your command line, first clone Simplefolio:

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/SarathAdhi/react-portfolio-template

# Move into the repository
$ cd react-portfolio-template

# Remove the current origin repository
$ git remote remove origin
```

After that, you can install the dependencies either using NPM or Yarn.

Using NPM: Simply run the below commands.

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start the development server
$ npm run dev
```

Using Yarn: Be aware of that you'll need to delete the `package-lock.json` file before executing the below commands.

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ yarn

# Start the development server
$ yarn run dev
```

Once your server has started, go to this url `http://localhost:3000/` to see the portfolio locally. It should look like the below screenshot.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
